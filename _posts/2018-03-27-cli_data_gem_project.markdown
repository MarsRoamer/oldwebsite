This has been an extremely rewarding project.  I was a little intimidated at first, but everything ended up coming together.  I felt that I was still a little shaky  in regards to my understanding of objects, and how they interact with each other, but this lab really helped to solidify everything! 

I wanted to make something that I would be interested in using personally, even though it is extremely primitive, it will be a good foundation to build-upon.  The app scrapes the website bodybuilding.com, and returns a list of body parts.  The user can then select a body part, and will be shown a collection of exercises that target that particular body part.  

There are times when I'm working out and am not feeling very creative that I just google different exercises, and eventually this will be something I can use instead.  I plan to add descriptions for each exercise, eventually a GUI, as well as pictures and videos.  There are also numerous other features, but I won't bore anyone with the details!

Starting from nothing, and building a usable product was a great confidence booster! It's an awesome feeling when you get that 'Ah-ha!' moment, because as I said above, I didn't feel like I really grasped the concept of OOP until this project.  It was also a good reminder to not get too frustrated with myself in the learning process, but rather just keep at it and approach the issues from multiple angles until it finally clicks.  I believe patience and persistence can take a person anywhere they want to go, and programming is no exception.  If you're interested, check out the repo for my gem: https://github.com/MarsRoamer/BodyBuilding-CLI-App-Revised.  And make any mods/improvements that you see fit!
