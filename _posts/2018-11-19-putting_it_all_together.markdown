The final project, which is a culmination of everything weâ€™ve learned from the course, was certainly more challenging than I had anticipated! Not necessarily because it really introduced any new material(although it somewhat did), but rather because architecting an app from the ground up was something that I had initially taken lightly.  For all the other applications we built during the course, we had a particular structure to follow, but with this we were left up to our own devices. And instead of sitting down and having a game plan prior, I just decided to start building.

That ended up being a glaring mistake. I had the idea, and a rough idea how I wanted it to function, but what I neglected to do was think critically about how effectively I would be able to transform my vision into the final product.  Which resulted in a lot of back and forth and redundant and useless code.  I left myself a mess that I had to navigate through as I proceeded, which left the application prone to bugs.  

After about a week and half of being stubborn and trying to properly implement the flow of information in my app off the top of my head, I scrapped everything and essentially started from scratch.  I forced myself to sit-down  and write out not only how I wanted the features to work, but how I could implement them properly.   

This was the turning point for me, because previously I was working on solving self inflicted problems, but now I had a well thought out plan to reference.  I reined in my initial functionality considerably, and just focused on producing  a minimally viable product.  I now have a good foundation to  build and expand upon, and look forward to  implementing all the additional functionality that excited by about the idea originally. So I guess the takeaway would be to plan big, but start small.  A robust program is ultimately a marathon, rather than a sprint.
