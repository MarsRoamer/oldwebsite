I just want to outline my game plan now that I’ve finished the course.  I’ve become fairly familiar with some tools for web development, which is awesome, but what I really feel I need to focus on is the craft itself. By that I mean problem solving with algorithmic thinking.  And Ruby/JS are merely tools to accomplish this, but my focus is now on the approach to the problems, rather than jumping directly to the code.  
I’ve recently started to try an solve some more complex problems, for example, performing a merge sort.  And I’ve come to find out that all the Rails knowledge in the world won’t really help me with this in the least, so I need to really spend time and understand the foundations of Computer Science, and the theory and mathematical approach behind it.  So my plan for this is to complete an algorithm course(which I’m currently doing), read and comprehend the book “Computer Science Distilled”, and work on leveling up my javascript skills as a whole.  I feel if I take this steps, it will really help bridge that knowledge gap, and also boost my confidence.
